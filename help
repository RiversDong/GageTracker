GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker): A program for tracking gene age by macro- and micro- collinearity
Version 1.3
Usage:
    GageTracker example.ctl [options] ...

Options:
    -h, --help     show all options and their default settings, and exit
    -V, --version  show version information, and exit
    -mos           mask the outgroup species using windowmasker (default: NOT mask the outgroup species)
    -lg            align the large genome using lastal5 (default: lastal)
    -p             running the program in multi-processes
    -ao, -step1    only perform alignments and get the rbh alignment according to the outgroup species. The reference species will be considered withon "#" at the beganing of reference
    -da, -step2    only perform gene dating accofing to the ctl files
    -m             infer the originating mechanism for young genes

Examples:
    GageTracker dm.ctl                dating gene age without masking outgroups genomes (for genome size <1 Gb)
    GageTracker dm.ctl -m             dating gene age and infer originating mechanism
    GageTracker zebrafish.ctl -lg     dating gene age without masking outgroups genomes (for genome size >1 Gb)
    GageTracker human.ctl -lg -mos    dating gene age with masking outgroups genomes (for large genome size ~3 Gb)
    GageTracker dm.ctl -ao/-step1     only perform the genome alignment
    GageTracker dm.ctl -da/-step2     gene dating based on the result from the alignment results of -ao/-step1
    

Prepare the control file
    1. branch name: designate different evolutionary branches from young to old. For example:
        branch = ["B8", "B7", "B6", "B5", "B4", "B3", "B2", "B1", "B0", "B-1", "B-2"]
    2. designate the old branch
        old_br = ["B0", "B-1", "B-2"]
    3. set the path to the target protein sequences
        protein_seq = "/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/dvirilis.faa"
    4. set the path to the target genome
        target = "/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/fasta/dvirilis.fasta"
    5. set the path to the target genome annotation file
        annotation = "/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/dvirilis.gtf"
    6. set the path to the outgroup genomes
        reference["B7"] = ["/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/fasta/damericana.fasta", "/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/fasta/dnovamexicana.fasta"]
        reference["B6"] = ["/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/fasta/dmontana.fasta"]
    7. set the path to the output result
        outpath = "/home/chuand/new_gene/virilis/dating"
    8. designate the final output file
        age = "age.result"
    9. voting number
        voting = 3
