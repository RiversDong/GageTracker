GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker): A program for tracking gene age by macro- and micro- collinearity
Version 1.3
Usage:
    GageTracker example.ctl [options] ...

Options:
    -h, --help     show all options and their default settings, and exit
    -V, --version  show version information, and exit
    -mos           mask the outgroup species using windowmasker (default: NOT mask the outgroup species)
    -lg            align the large genome using lastal5 (default: lastal)
    -p             running the program in multi-processes
    -ao, -step1    only perform alignments and get the rbh alignment according to the outgroup species. The reference species will be considered withon "#" at the beganing of reference
    -rbh or -step2  calculate the rBH regions by cosindering the genome alignment.
    -da or -step3   only performs gene dating according to the ctl files.
    -m          infer the originating mechanism for young genes (based on the BLASTp alignments)

Examples:
    GageTracker dm.ctl                  Dating gene age without masking outgroups genomes (for genome size <1 Gb)
    GageTracker dm.ctl -m -p 12         Dating gene age and infer originating mechanism with 12 processes
    GageTracker zebrafish.ctl -lg -p 2  Dating gene age without masking outgroups genomes (for genome size >1 Gb)
    GageTracker human.ctl -lg -mos      Dating gene age with masking outgroups genomes (for large genome size ~3 Gb)
    GageTracker dm.ctl -ao -mos         Only run the genome alignment with masking the outgroup species
    GageTracker dm.ctl -rbh -p 5        Get the RBH alignments based on the genome alignments with 5 processes
    GageTracker dm.ctl -da -p 5         Get the gene age based on the results from the previous two steps (genome alignment and RBH results) with 5 processes
